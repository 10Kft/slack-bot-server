# Contributing

Thanks for helping make this software better! Contributing is super easy, with just a few guidelines.

## Bugs

If you've found a bug in the software, please report it using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/exciting-io/slack_bot_server/issues). Please include the version (or SHA) of this project that you're using, along with which version of Ruby and any other dependencies that you think might be relevant.

## Features

If you'd got an idea for an improvement or a new feature, that's fantastic! We only ask that you also include specs to cover that behaviour, and that you implement it in a branch to easy merging.

1. Create a new branch for your feature
2. Implement it, along with new/modified specs
3. Submit a pull request describing the motivation for your new feature, and how to use it.

Please don't bump the gem version -- we'll take care of that.

Thanks again, and have a great day!
